# CROSS THE STREET

##. I. How to play?

- Use your arrow keys: up, down, left, right.
- If you collide with the bugs, you will be eaten.
- If you cross to the other side, which is the river, you will win.


##. II. How to run the app.

- Open the index.html on your browser, you will be able to run the game.
- If you want to modify, you will need to install some dependencies:
       
    ```
    yarn install
    yarn build
    ```

- This will run `wepback` and watch for your modifications.
